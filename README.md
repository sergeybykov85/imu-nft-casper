## NOTICE
1. Right now, IMU-NFT component works with the CEP47 NFT standard of the Casper blockchain. The folder `nft-cep47` contains the code of the smartcontract that was used to mint NFTs. 
It is based on the CEP47 NFT standard of the Casper ecosystem. The certain version of the nft smart contract has "auto-incrementted" nft ids and supports "upgrade" mode as well.
2. There is no full code of the imu nft component! Imu nft component is a generic component to deliver nfs from various blockchains and process the user action. 
The folder `imu-nft-ui` contains ONLY some files related to the casper-wallet integration and related logic.
3. The folder `screens` contains some screens of the IMU NFT-C compoment.
