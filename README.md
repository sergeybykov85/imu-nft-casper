## NOTICE
1. Right now, IMU-NFT component works with the CEP47 standard of the Casper blockchain. The folder `nft-cep47` contains code that was used to mint NFTs. It is based on the cep47 standard. 
Current nft smart contract has "auto-incrementted" ids and supports "upgrade" mode.
2. There is no full code of the imu nft component! The folder `imu-nft-ui` contains only snippets of the code related to the casper-wallet integration.
3. The folder `screens` contains some screens of the IMU NFT-C compoment.
